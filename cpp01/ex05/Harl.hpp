//Harl also has a public member function that calls the four member functions above
//depending on the level passed as parameter:

//void complain( std::string level );

//The goal of this exercise is to use pointers to member functions. This is not a
//suggestion. Harl has to complain without using a forest of if/else if/else. It doesnâ€™t think
//twice!
